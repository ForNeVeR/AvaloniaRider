Changelog
=========
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

When considering version compatibility (and thus incrementing the major version), we only consider the configuration file major user experience changes. The host IDE version is not considered a version compatibility factor (since otherwise we'd have to increase the major version pretty often and that would make no sense).
